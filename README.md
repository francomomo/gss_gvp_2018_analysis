# Overview

This repo features an analysis of the Giving, Volunteering, and Participating landscape of Canadian residents in 2018. This repo contains the R scripts and the final pdf report of the paper [(link)](https://github.com/francomomo/gss_gvp_2018_analysis/blob/main/outputs/paper/paper.pdf). The analysis shows that people gave and volunteered mostly because they were personally affected by their giving and volunteering situation, and team sports were the most participated youth activities.

We obtained the data "General social survey: Giving, Volunteering and Participating (cycle 33), 2018" from the University of Toronto Database CHASS (Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences).
